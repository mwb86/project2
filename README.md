# README
This is an app designed to connect racquetball players in RI. It allows a user to create an account and post to the community board. The user can also comment on others posts. The user has full control to view, edit and delete their posts, comments or account. They can also delete others comments on their posts. The user has a personal profile page containing all their posts. The relationships are one user to to many posts, one user to many comments, one post has many users and comments.

The app was built with ruby on rails. The gem devise was used for creating users and authenticating them. The gem paginate was used to only display 10 posts at a time. Animate.css was used to put the pulse affect on the menu buttons near the bottom of the page.

I'm planning to finish up the gym section of the webpage. I will have it display each gym with its corresponding members and posts.
I would also like to add paginate to some of the other views.
The site also needs some more style improvements.
An admin feature needs to be added so that any post, comment or gym can be modified or deleted.
